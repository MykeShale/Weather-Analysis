# Weather Data Analysis
This repository contains code and data for a weather data analysis project using Python and Pandas. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze weather data to gain insights into climate patterns and trends.

## Data

The weather data used in this project is from: https://datasciencelovers.graphy.com/products/Dataset--Project-1---Weather-Data-Analysis-64d48ec74065076bdfbcc4db?dgps_s=ucpd&dgps_t=cp_u

The data includes the following variables:

1. Date
2. Time
3. Temperature
4. Humidity
5. Wind speed
6. Fog
7. Wind direction
8. Cloud cover
9. Precipitation
10. Analysis

## Analysis

1. **Descriptive statistics:** Calculate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other descriptive statistics for each variable.
Data visualization: Create charts and graphs to visualize the data and identify patterns and trends.
2. **Time series analysis:** Analyze the data over time to identify seasonal and long-term trends.
Correlation analysis: Calculate the correlation coefficient between different variables to identify relationships between them.
Findings


### The analysis performed on the weather dataset includes:

1. Finding the basic descriptive statistics of the dataset, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.
2. Finding the unique values of each column in the dataset.
3. Finding the number of times each unique value appears in the dataset.
4. Finding the null values in the dataset.
5. Finding all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
6. Finding all instances when 'Wind Speed is 4km/h' and 'Visibility is > 40'.
7. Finding the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'.

## Code
The Python code for the data analysis can be found in the file Weather Analysis.ipynb. 
The code is written in Jupyter Notebook format, which is an interactive environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Requirements
To run the Python code, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib

## Instructions

To run the data analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file weather_data_analysis.ipynb.
4. Run the code in the notebook to perform the data analysis.

## Output
The output of the Python code is a Jupyter Notebook file that contains the results of the data analysis. The output includes tables, charts, and plots that summarize the findings of the analysis.
